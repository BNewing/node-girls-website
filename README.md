## How to contribute?

This project is basic frontend HTML and CSS, built using the Materialize CSS library and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Some quick tips:
* To add a chapter, you will need to add a `<city>.html` file to the root directory
* To add an event, add it to Current Events in the `<city>.html`, `index.html`, and `events.html` files (bonus points if you remember to move it to Past Events once the event ends)
* To add mentors, add their photo to the `images` directory, set the background image as a class in the CSS file, and add them to the relevant `<city>.html` file

Please feel free to make pull requests and add your own chapter of Node Girls. More detailed instructions of how to contribute to this repository are coming. And hopefully, the website will be improved upon sometime soon.

In the meantime, feel free to ping us with any questions. This repository is most actively maintained by @msmichellegar, @minaorangina and @claireinez. One of us will review any pull requests before merging into the main branch.
